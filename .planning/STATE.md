# STATE.md

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-07-25)

**Core value:** A developer can clone this template, run `bun install && docker compose up && bun dev`, and immediately have a working local auth stack, database migrations, and a deployable application structure.

**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Developer Experience & Verification

## Current Status

- Phase 1 (Core Monorepo & Auth): Complete
- Phase 2 (AWS Infrastructure): Complete
- Phase 3 (Developer Experience & Verification): Complete

## Recent Work

- Switched Docker Compose PostgreSQL image to `postgres:16-alpine`.
- Updated README to reflect Winston logger, `@workspace/files`, floci S3, and Terraform.
- Added Terraform modules for ECR, network, EKS, and gateway with dev/prod environments.
- Initialized GSD planning artifacts (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, config.json).
- Re-ran graphify on the current codebase (879 nodes, 1036 edges, 53 communities).
- Fixed missing `@workspace/logger` dependency in `@workspace/auth`.
- Verified `bun install`, `bun run build`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run test` all pass.
- Fixed `apps/api/Dockerfile` and `apps/web/Dockerfile` build command syntax (`bun run --cwd <app> <script>`).
- Built and pushed `template-mono-repo/api:latest` and `template-mono-repo/web:latest` to the floci ECR registry at `000000000000.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.localhost:5100`.

## Next Actions

1. Address any new issues opened against the template.
2. Add Kubernetes manifests and CI/CD image push in a future phase.

## Blockers

None.

## Notes

- The repository is a template, not a live product. Requirements are framed as template capabilities.
- GitHub issues were created to track remaining tasks.
